## Using this
It's pretty straightforward. Copy everything in this repository to your home directory. If you're using a graphical file manager, you may need to enable displaying hidden files. As for the gtksourceview theme, if you want to use pluma or gedit like I do, copy `night.xml` to `/usr/share/gtksourceview-X.0/styles/` replacing `X` with 2 or 3, depending on your installed version.
